# Feed Intelligence — Implementation Roadmap

> **Companion to** [`feed-intelligence-plan.md`](feed-intelligence-plan.md) (research + architecture). This is the **actionable, milestone-based TODO**.
> **Created:** 2026-07-16.

## North-star UX (the thing every milestone serves)

> **A user pastes a URL. If they have an AI key, the AI figures out the whole setup and proposes it. They just confirm.**

No thinking about selectors, XPath, item boundaries, or full-text rules. The manual Scout Studio controls stay for power users and for people without an AI key, but the *happy path* is: **paste → AI proposes → preview → accept.** Everything below is built so the AI layer can slot on top of a working manual layer (AI proposes a config; the same config also works if typed by hand).

**Guiding principles**
- **AI proposes, human confirms** — never auto-save an AI-generated config silently; always show a live preview and let the user accept/tweak. (Also keeps us safe from hallucinated selectors.)
- **Config once, scrape forever** — AI generates a reusable selector config (cheap, one-shot). Per-article AI is the fallback, not the default (cost).
- **In-process first** — default path needs no extra services; connectors are optional (see plan §4b).
- **Never regress SSRF** — every fetch of a user-supplied URL goes through `lib/ssrf.ts`.
- **Reuse what exists** — Scout Studio config model, `ffx:*` OPML, AI BYOK (`lib/ai-summary.ts`), auto-full-text trigger, retention, conditional GET.

## Milestone M1 — Auto full-text → clean, format-selectable content ✅ *shipped (PRs #141–#143)*
*Phase 1.1 + 1.2. The mission's first ask.*

**User outcome:** truncated feeds automatically show the full article; the user picks **Markdown (clean/aligned) or HTML** per feed, and can override per article. No selectors needed.

- [x] **M1-T1** `lib/readability-extract.ts` — automatic extractor: **Defuddle** (primary, on our existing JSDOM) → **Mozilla Readability** fallback when Defuddle returns empty → keep feed summary if both fail. SSRF-safe fetch via `lib/ssrf.ts`. Returns `{ html, markdown, title, byline, excerpt, wordCount, extractedBy }`. — `M`
- [x] **M1-T2** Add deps: `defuddle`, `@mozilla/readability`, `markdown-it` (+`markdown-it` plugins as needed), `turndown`(+gfm, as a selector-path MD converter). Confirm they run under our Node/JSDOM + `serverExternalPackages`. — `S`
- [x] **M1-T3** Schema: `Article.contentFormat` (`"html" | "markdown"`, default per feed) + `Feed.fullTextMode` (`"off" | "auto" | "selector"`) and `Feed.defaultContentFormat`. Prisma migrate via `db push`. — `S`
- [x] **M1-T4** Wire "auto" mode into the existing full-text flow (`lib/feed-fetcher.ts` `autoFetchFullText` / sync path): when `fullTextMode="auto"`, run M1-T1 and store the chosen format. Keep manual per-article "fetch full text" working. — `M`
- [x] **M1-T5** Reader render path for Markdown: `markdown-it` → **DOMPurify** (already present) → existing `.article-content` prose. Add a per-article/per-feed **Markdown ⟷ HTML toggle** in the reader UI. Old HTML articles keep rendering (respect `contentFormat`). — `M` *(the toggle was later removed 2026-07-19, maintainer call — see CHANGELOG)*
- [x] **M1-T6** *(shipped, 2026-07-19)* **Truncated-feed detection + suggestion** — `Feed.fullTextMode` defaults to `"off"`, so a feed that deliberately ships only a short teaser (WordPress "Summary" mode, e.g. Caschys Blog) never gets auto full-text unless someone notices and flips it on. `lib/full-text-mode.ts`'s `looksLikeTruncatedFeed` detects this empirically — a manual "Fetch full text" landing dramatically more content than the feed provided — and `fetchFullText` surfaces a dismissible "enable automatic full text for this feed?" toast (`Feed.fullTextAutoSuggestDismissed` remembers a decline). Works retroactively on any pre-existing feed, triggered by the user's own first manual fetch.
- [x] **M1-T6** Settings UX: in Feed Settings, a simple **"Full text: Off / Automatic / Custom selector"** control + **"Preferred format: Markdown / HTML"**. Automatic requires zero further input. i18n en+de. — `M`
- [x] **M1-T7** Tests: extractor unit tests (fixture HTML → expected markdown/plain), fallback path, format round-trip; verify sanitization on the markdown→HTML render. — `M`

**Acceptance:** add a known truncated feed → set Automatic → articles show full clean content; toggling Markdown/HTML re-renders; nothing leaks unsanitized HTML; `tsc`/`lint`/`test`/`build` green. **Deps:** none. **Risk:** extraction quality (mitigated by fallback + M3 manual + M4 AI); storage growth (retention covers it).

---

## Milestone M2 — Full-text polish
*Phase 1.3.*

- [x] **M2-T1** *(shipped, 2026-07-20)* GFM tables (`markdown-it` already renders these natively — no gap), code blocks (`highlight.js`, `atom-one-dark` theme — Tailwind Typography already gives code blocks a fixed dark background in both site themes, so one dark syntax theme is correct everywhere), task lists (`markdown-it-task-lists`, real `<input type="checkbox" disabled>` instead of literal `[x]` text). Footnotes not done — not part of GFM proper, deferred. — `S`
- [x] **M2-T2** *(shipped, 2026-07-20)* Math via KaTeX (`@vscode/markdown-it-katex`), pre-rendered to static HTML+MathML server-side (no client JS needed). Needed one sanitizer fix: the shared inline-style-stripping DOMPurify hook (added for scraped-page layout safety) was also stripping the `width` styles KaTeX depends on for symbol spacing — now exempted for anything inside a `.katex` subtree, which isn't attacker-controlled the way scraped source-page styles are. — `S–M`
- [x] **M2-T3** *(shipped, 2026-07-20)* Image handling: `https:` images already worked, inline `width`/`min-width` stripping already shipped earlier (Phase 0.1); added `loading="lazy"` to markdown-rendered images (HTML-format articles already had it). — `S`
- [x] **M2-T4** *(already shipped)* Per-feed `defaultContentFormat` (`Feed.defaultContentFormat`) already existed from M1. No further work needed.

**Acceptance:** rich articles (tables/code/math/images) render cleanly in both formats and themes on mobile + desktop. **Deps:** M1.

---

## Milestone M3 — Page → Feed builder (manual, in-process) ✅ *shipped (PRs #145–#147)*
*Phase 2.A, Model A. The foundation the AI layer (M4) sits on.*

**User outcome:** paste a *listing* page URL (blog index, forum, search results) → mark the repeating item + fields → save as a feed that re-scrapes on schedule. (Works without an AI key.)

- [x] **M3-T1** Generalize Scout Studio extraction to "**list of items from an arbitrary page**": given a page + an item selector + per-field selectors (title/link/date/summary/image), produce feed items. Reuse the existing XPath/CSS engine in `lib/feed-extraction.ts`. — `M`
- [x] **M3-T2** **Ranked candidate suggestion** for the repeating-item container (extend the current Scout Studio ranking: repetition count, structural similarity, link density) + live preview of the parsed items. — `M`
- [x] **M3-T3** "**Create feed from a web page**" entry point (new-feed dialog → "This page has no RSS? Build one"): fetch (SSRF-safe) → pick item → map fields → preview → save as a synthetic feed (`sourceType` extension). — `M`
- [x] **M3-T4** Persist as a normal feed; re-scrape on the sync schedule; dedup via existing unicity keys; export/import through the `ffx:*` OPML extension (FreshRSS interop). — `M`
- [x] **M3-T5** Tests + docs (extend `docs/scout-studio.md`). — `S`

**Acceptance:** turn a real static listing page (e.g. a blog index) into a working, auto-refreshing feed by clicking through the builder. **Deps:** M1-T1 (shared fetch/clean). **Risk:** page structure variety (M4 AI + candidate ranking help); JS-only pages out of scope here (→ M5b/M7).

---

## Milestone M4 — AI config proposal ⭐ (the north-star UX) ✅ *shipped (PRs #149, #155, #156)*
*Phase 2.C1. "Paste a URL, the AI sets it up."*

**User outcome (with an AI key):** paste any URL → AI analyzes it → **proposes the complete config** (full-text selector for a truncated feed, *or* the item + field selectors for a page→feed) → live preview → user accepts (or tweaks). No selector thinking.

- [x] **M4-T1** *(slice 1, PR #149)* `lib/ai-feed-config.ts` — takes a URL, fetches (SSRF-safe) + Defuddle-cleans the HTML (keep it small/tokens-bounded), sends a structured prompt to the user's BYOK provider (`lib/ai-summary.ts` plumbing), and gets back a **strict JSON config** matching our Scout Studio schema (`{ mode: "fulltext"|"pagefeed", itemSelector?, fields?, fullTextSelector?, confidence, notes }`). — `M`
- [x] **M4-T2** *(slice 1, PR #149)* **Validate before showing:** run the proposed config through the real extraction engine (M1/M3) server-side, return a **preview** (extracted article / parsed items) alongside the config + a confidence signal. Never save unseen. — `M`
- [x] **M4-T3** *(slice 2, PR #155 — add-feed "From web page" flow; the feed-settings full-text entry point is folded into T5)* UX: a single **"✨ Let AI set this up"** button in the add-feed / full-text flow → spinner → shows the preview + an editable summary of what the AI chose → **Accept** (saves the config) or **Edit** (drops into the manual Scout Studio fields, pre-filled). Falls back to manual if no AI key / AI fails. i18n en+de. — `M`
- [x] **M4-T4** *(slice 1 size caps + slice 2 rate-limit, PRs #149/#150/#155)* Guardrails: token/size caps on the page sent to the model; rate-limit (`lib/rate-limit.ts`); clear error states; the AI call is **one-shot config generation** (not per-fetch) — after Accept it's plain selector scraping. — `S`
- [x] **M4-T5** *(slice 3, PR #156 — "✨" button in feed settings → Full Text tab; proposes + engine-validates the selector against the feed's latest article, fills the field, user saves manually)* Also offer AI proposal for **M1 truncated-feed full-text** (propose the article-body selector automatically), not just page→feed. — `S`
- [x] **M4-T6** *(slice 1, PR #149)* Tests (mocked AI returning good/garbage JSON → validation catches garbage; preview path). — `M`

**Acceptance:** with a valid AI key, pasting a blog index *or* a truncated-feed article URL yields a correct, preview-backed config the user accepts in one click; with no key, the manual builder (M3) still works. **Deps:** M1, M3. **Risk:** hallucinated/invalid selectors (mitigated by mandatory server-side validation + preview + confirm); provider variance (strict JSON schema + retry/repair); cost (one-shot + caps).

---

## Milestone M5 — Optional self-hosted connectors (Model B)
*Phase 2.B. Broad coverage + JS rendering without us maintaining scrapers.*

**User outcome:** an admin can point FeedFerret at a self-hosted RSSHub and/or changedetection.io; users then get platform feeds and any-page monitoring — the AI can even pick the right route/watch for them.

- [~] **M5a — RSSHub connector** — `M` — *engine slice shipped 2026-07-20 (`lib/rsshub.ts` + admin config), UI slice ("Add from platform") still pending*
  - [x] Admin setting: RSSHub base URL (+ optional key); reachable only via SSRF-allowlisted host. — `GlobalSettings.rsshubEnabled/rsshubBaseUrl/rsshubApiKey` (encrypted), mirrors the render-sidecar (M7-T2) admin-config pattern exactly. `testRsshubConnection` action smoke-tests via RSSHub's own GitHub-releases route (always exists, no platform auth needed).
  - [ ] "Add from platform" UX: user names a source (YouTube channel, subreddit, GitHub repo releases…) → we build the RSSHub route → add as feed. AI can map "this YouTube URL" → the route. — *engine ready (`proposeAndValidateRoute`, mirrors M4's "AI proposes, engine validates"), UI not yet built.*
  - [x] Hidden entirely when unconfigured. — `getRsshubStatus()` (`app/actions/feeds.ts`) exposes `isRsshubConfigured()` to any authenticated user for UI gating.
  - **Design note:** once a route is known, an RSSHub-backed feed IS just a plain RSS/Atom feed at `<rsshubBaseUrl><route>` — no new `sourceType`, sync path, or OPML handling needed. `validateRsshubRoute` reuses the exact same `fetchFeedArticles()` every other RSS feed already goes through.
- [ ] **M5b — changedetection.io connector** — `M`
  - [ ] Admin setting: changedetection base URL + API key.
  - [ ] "Monitor this page → feed": create a **watch** via its REST API (with CSS/xpath filter, optional restock/price processor), subscribe to its RSS output as a feed. Leans on its **own browser rendering** for JS pages (so we don't run Playwright in-process).
  - [ ] AI assist: propose the watch's filter/selector from the page (reuse M4).
- [ ] **M5-T3** Docs: `docs/self-hosting.md` connector setup; SSRF/network-isolation guidance. — `S`

**Acceptance:** with a sidecar configured, a user adds e.g. a YouTube channel (RSSHub) and a no-RSS product page (changedetection) as feeds; with no sidecar, the options are cleanly absent. **Deps:** M3/M4 for the AI-assist bits. **Risk:** ops burden (strictly optional); sidecar is an SSRF surface (isolate + allowlist).

---

## Milestone M6 — Per-article AI extraction fallback ✅ *shipped 2026-07-20*
*Phase 2.C2. For sites too unstable for a fixed selector config.*

- [x] **M6-T1** Opt-in per-feed "AI extraction" mode: when selectors are unreliable, run the article HTML through the BYOK model to extract clean content per article. — `M` — *`Feed.fullTextMode` gained a 4th value, `"ai"` (Settings → feed → Full Text tab, only offered once an AI provider is configured). `lib/ai-extraction.ts` asks the model for a strict-JSON `{title, content}` (content as Markdown, preserving structure — not a summary). Wired into `fetchAndExtractReadable` (`lib/readability-extract.ts`) as a new tier that runs on the already-fetched HTML, right after the free deterministic tiers (ftr/Defuddle/Readability/extractus/JSON-LD) all come up empty, and before the (slower, whole-page-refetching) render sidecar — since it's a smarter *parser* fallback, not a JS-rendering one. `extractedBy: "ai"` for observability.*
- [x] **M6-T2** Strong guardrails: opt-in only, per-user rate limits, token caps, cost visibility, cache results (don't re-extract unchanged articles — reuse contentHash). — `M` — *Opt-in via the per-feed mode itself (never runs unless a feed is explicitly switched to "ai"). Token caps: `reduceHtmlForPrompt` (shared with M4's `lib/ai-feed-config.ts`) bounds the page HTML sent to the model, and the output is capped at 2000 tokens. Rate/cost limit: capped at 5 AI-extraction calls per sync batch per feed (`MAX_AI_EXTRACTIONS_PER_SYNC_BATCH`, `lib/rss-sync.ts`) — a feed's initial backfill can't blow through the user's API budget in one tick; articles beyond the cap still get the free deterministic tiers. "Don't re-extract unchanged articles": no new caching layer needed — `autoFetchFullTextViaEngine` already only ever runs on `upsertedIds` (newly-arrived/changed articles for that sync), so an already-processed article is never revisited. Cost visibility UI deferred (not blocking — the per-feed opt-in plus the sync-batch cap are the primary safeguards for v1).*

**Acceptance:** a site that M4 selectors can't pin down still yields clean articles in AI-extraction mode, within rate/cost limits. **Deps:** M1, M4. **Risk:** ongoing token cost (gated + cached), latency (async, off the render path).

---

## Milestone M7 — Heavy rendering / anti-bot (optional, top of the ramp)
*Phase 2.D.*

> **Research 2026-07-17 (r1) + 2026-07-18 (r2)** ([`scraping-engines-research.md`](scraping-engines-research.md)): tiered plan — **T0** cheap in-process HTTP impersonation (`impit`+`header-generator`) → **T1** in-process render on `rebrowser-playwright` → **T2** optional **crawl4ai** sidecar → **T3** BYOK hosted (Jina / Firecrawl **Cloud**). Firecrawl *self-host* demoted (anti-bot engine cloud-only, 7 containers). Skip: got-scraping (EOL), puppeteer stealth plugin (dead), autoscraper/browser-use.

- [x] **M7-T0** *(shipped, PR #160)* Browser-fingerprint fetch via **`impit`** on the page-fetch paths (page→feed, AI config, full-text) — real Chrome TLS/HTTP2 fingerprints, still through `lib/ssrf.ts` with per-hop SSRF re-validation (`redirect: manual`). Routine feed-XML sync left on plain fetch (proven path). `FEEDFERRET_DISABLE_IMPIT=1` kill-switch + graceful fallback if the native binary is missing. `header-generator` deferred to T1 (browser header injection). — `S`
- [~] **M7-T1** *(revised 2026-07-18 — embedded-data extraction, replaces the in-process-browser plan)* Extract content that "JS" pages still ship in the HTML: `__NEXT_DATA__`, `<script type="application/json">` blobs, JSON-LD lists — for article full-text AND listing→feed. In-process, **no Docker impact**, no browser. Covers a real slice of JS sites (Wired-class). — `S–M`
  - [x] **ftr-site-config importer** *(shipped)* — bundled subset of FiveFilters [`ftr-site-config`](https://github.com/fivefilters/ftr-site-config) (CC0/public-domain) per-site rules as a generated TS module (`lib/ftr-site-configs.ts`, 44 curated high-value hosts incl. German outlets). `lib/ftr-site-config.ts` parses the `body/title/author/date/strip/strip_id_or_class` XPath directives and applies them in-process (jsdom `document.evaluate`); wired as the **first extraction tier** in `lib/readability-extract.ts` (`extractedBy: "ftr"`), ahead of Defuddle/Readability, with graceful fall-through when no rule matches or a rule yields too little. `FEEDFERRET_DISABLE_FTR=1` kill-switch. Regenerate via `scripts/gen-ftr-site-configs.mjs`. **No Docker/network/runtime-fs impact** (rules are compiled into the bundle).
  - [x] **JSON-LD `articleBody` recovery** *(shipped, PR #162)* — full text pulled from schema.org structured data when the visible DOM is a thin teaser (Wired-class paywall/truncation).
  - [ ] `__NEXT_DATA__` / embedded-JSON **listing→feed** extraction — no confirmed target yet; deferred.
- [x] **M7-T2** *(shipped — sidecar, not in-process browser)* Optional admin-configured **browser sidecar** (crawl4ai / lean Playwright service) for genuinely client-only pages T1 can't reach — HTTP connector (base URL + encrypted token, hidden until enabled), default image untouched, browser isolated. `lib/render-sidecar.ts` (config resolution + response parser + `renderViaSidecar`), wired as a **fallback** into `fetchAndExtractReadable` (full-text) and `fetchAndSuggestFeedCandidates` (page→feed) — used only after the in-process path comes up empty. Target URL still SSRF-validated (no bypass); `GlobalSettings.renderSidecar{Enabled,Url,Token}` + admin UI (Sync tab) with Test button; ENV override (`FEEDFERRET_RENDER_SIDECAR_URL`/`_TOKEN`) + `FEEDFERRET_DISABLE_RENDER_SIDECAR` kill-switch. Setup + contract + reference sidecar in [`render-sidecar.md`](render-sidecar.md). **In-process browser in the default image rejected** (~400–500 MB for everyone + runs in the reader's container). Wired up **by default** in `docker-compose.yaml` (a shared `RENDER_SIDECAR_TOKEN` wires both services). Bugs found + fixed on first real-world use: `SIDECAR_PORT` (not `PORT`, to survive a deploy platform injecting env vars project-wide across every service in a Compose stack), a `contain: layout` + inline-`position` sanitizer hardening (a rendered page's fixed/sticky element could escape the reader's `overflow: hidden` container), and detailed Test-button diagnostics.
- [x] **M7-T3** *(shipped)* **BYOK hosted-API connector** (Model C) — per-user, opt-in, own key for Jina Reader or Firecrawl Cloud, the only tier that reliably clears many *active* anti-bot/paywall challenges (these providers run far more sophisticated, actively-maintained anti-bot infrastructure than any tier above). `lib/hosted-fetch.ts` implements both providers, returning clean Markdown (rendered to HTML via the existing Markdown pipeline); wired into `fetchAndExtractReadable` as the final fallback after the sidecar. Manual "Fetch full text" always tries it when configured; automatic background sync only uses it if the user explicitly enables `contentFetchAutoUse` (never a silent cost/privacy surprise). Settings → Integrations section mirrors the AI-summary BYOK UX (provider, encrypted key, privacy-warning callout, Test connection). `FEEDFERRET_DISABLE_HOSTED_FETCH=1` kill-switch. Honest limits: never "always works" — still probabilistic against a determined active challenge.
  - [x] **Firecrawl keyless free tier** *(shipped, 2026-07-19)* — Firecrawl's `/v1/scrape` also serves requests with no API key at all, free and rate-limited per server IP per day (verified directly against the live endpoint) rather than per user, letting a self-hoster try the connector — and gauge whether a paid Firecrawl key is worth it — before ever entering a key. `getHostedFetchConfigForUser`/`fetchViaHostedApiDetailed` (`lib/hosted-fetch.ts`) treat a Firecrawl selection with no stored key as this tier; a 429 is surfaced as a distinguishable `rateLimited` outcome all the way to the "Test connection" button and a real "Fetch full text" click (a dedicated `HostedFetchRateLimitedError`, caught in `fetchFullText`), instead of a generic failure message. Jina Reader is unaffected — still requires a key.

**Acceptance:** a JS-only / mildly anti-bot page that all earlier tiers miss can be captured via the opt-in heavy path. **Deps:** M3–M5. **Risk:** RAM/CPU (isolate), fragility, ToS — position as last resort.

**M7 is now feature-complete** (T0–T3 all shipped) — the full staged "convert anything into RSS" heavy-fetch path from cheap in-process impersonation up to per-user hosted BYOK.

**Recommended delivery order:** **M1 → M3 → M4** gets us to the north-star ("paste a URL, AI sets up any feed") entirely in-process/self-hosted. **M2** slots in whenever (polish). **M5** adds the big coverage jump once the core is solid. **M6/M7** are demand-driven.

Each milestone ships as its own verified PR(s) (`tsc`/`lint`/`test`, `next build` on CSS/schema changes), with checkboxes ticked here as they land.

---

## Cross-cutting acceptance (applies to every milestone)
- SSRF: all user-URL fetches through `lib/ssrf.ts`; connectors/sidecars host-allowlisted.
- Privacy: in-process by default; any path that sends content off-box is opt-in + labelled.
- Cost: AI is one-shot config by default; per-article/hosted paths are opt-in + rate-limited + cached.
- i18n: all new strings en+de; `translations:check` green.
- Interop: preserve `ffx:*` OPML round-trip; consider importing `full-text-rss` site-config format later.
- Retention/perf: full text + scraped feeds honor retention + content caps + conditional GET.

## Post-core feature backlog (queued after M1–M7)

> Appended 2026-07-16. All the ideas from [`feature-ideas.md`](feature-ideas.md), queued behind the core Feed-Intelligence milestones and **sorted by effort, easy → complex**. Tags: 🟦 FreshRSS-parity · 🤖 AI-synergy · ⭐ high value. Two are recommended to pull *forward* (noted inline) because they ride along with core work.

### Tier S — quick wins
- [x] **F1** · "Refresh now" per feed (expose a manual force-refresh everywhere) — `S` — *shipped, Phase 0*
- [x] **F2** · Per-feed reader defaults (font / width / format override on top of the global prefs) — `S` — *shipped, Phase 0 (PR #137)*
- [x] **F3** · ⭐ Copy article as Markdown (nearly free once M1 lands) — `S` — *shipped, Phase 0 (PR #135)*

### Tier S–M
- [x] **F4** · ⭐ Command palette (⌘K / Ctrl-K) — `cmdk` is already a dependency — `S–M` — *shipped, Phase 0 (PR #135)*
- [ ] **F5** · Export / "Send to" Obsidian · Wallabag · Readwise · Pocket — `S–M`
- [ ] **F6** · Auto-mute + notify on persistently-failing feeds (we already track feed health) — `S–M`
- [ ] **F7** · PWA share-target bookmarklet ("Share → FeedFerret" → starts the page→feed flow) — `S–M`

### Tier M
- [x] **F8** · ⭐ 🤖 🟦 AI auto-tagging / classification of incoming articles (prompt → labels on sync) — `M` — *shipped 2026-07-20. Reused the existing user-facing Label/ArticleLabel schema instead of a new tag model — AI-proposed tags become real Labels, so they show up for free in the existing label badges, the article-reader label dropdown, and the sidebar's "Label:" filter with no new UI. `lib/ai-tagging.ts` prompts for ≤4 short topical tags per article (nudged to reuse the user's existing label names before minting near-duplicates), `lib/rss-sync.ts`'s new `autoTagNewArticles` runs it for newly-synced articles right after auto-summarize, gated on a new opt-in `User.aiAutoTag` toggle (Settings → AI, mirrors auto-summarize's own toggle) so it never runs without the user turning it on. `Article.aiTaggedAt` marks processed articles so a persistent per-sync cap doesn't mean silently never reaching older ones.*
- [ ] **F9** · 🤖 User-facing reading-stats dashboard (read-over-time, top feeds, streaks, "time saved by AI") — `M`
- [ ] **F10** · 🟦 Reverse-proxy / trusted-header auth (`X-Forwarded-User`) — `M`
- [ ] **F11** · Article notes / highlights (annotate passages, searchable) — `M`
- [ ] **F12** · 🤖 AI "translate this article" (one-click, BYOK) — `M`
- [ ] **F13** · 🟦 Theme presets + import/export (on top of the accent theming we have) — `M`

### Tier L
- [ ] **F14** · ⭐ 🟦 WebSub (PubSubHubbub) — real-time push instead of polling — `L`
- [ ] **F15** · ⭐ 🤖 Newsletter → feed (per-user inbound email address; optional M1 markdown clean-up) — `L`
- [ ] **F16** · 🤖 AI semantic / "find similar" search (embeddings + vector store) — `L`
- [ ] **F17** · Podcast / audio + "read aloud" (TTS) — `L` (aligns with the planned v2 audio surface)

### Tier XL
- [ ] **F18** · 🟦 Extension / event-hook surface — FreshRSS's biggest differentiator. Full plugins are XL; start lighter with an event/hook API on top of our existing webhooks + rules — `XL`
