# FeedFerret Roadmap

> Last updated: 2026-07-15 — v1.1.1 shipped; post-release work (digest expansion, search view, settings tabs, PRs #88–#96) merged to `main`. A full design audit (performance / UX / security / visuals) was run and **all 54 findings resolved** across eight merged PRs (#99–#102 for the four tiers, #104–#106 for the deferred features, plus `docs/design-system.md`); full status in [`design-audit-todo.md`](design-audit-todo.md). All documented in the CHANGELOG "Unreleased" section and feeds into v1.2.

This file is the **top-level index**. Each release has its own detailed planning document in [`docs/releases/`](releases/).

> **📋 Single ordered backlog across everything (releases + Feed Intelligence + feature ideas + quality backlogs): [`MASTER-ROADMAP.md`](MASTER-ROADMAP.md).** Start there for "what to work on next, in order."

## Versioning Policy

- **Patch (x.y.Z):** Bug fixes, security patches, doc corrections — no new features.
- **Minor (x.Y.0):** One or more new user-facing features. Full lint + typecheck + build must pass. CHANGELOG.md updated.
- **Major (X.0.0):** Significant new product surface (audio, native app) or breaking changes to API, auth, or DB schema.

Each release is planned in a dedicated `releases/vX.Y.md` file before work starts.
